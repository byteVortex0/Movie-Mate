# 🎬 Movie Mate

Movie Mate is a Flutter application built mainly for learning and practicing advanced Flutter concepts — not for design.
The focus of this project was to apply and experiment with core technical features, rather than building a visually polished UI.

## 🚀 Main Focus Areas

🎨 Theme Extension </br>
Implemented Flutter’s Theme Extension to manage themes in a clean, scalable, and maintainable way.
</br> </br>
🧠 API Caching</br>
Added smart caching for API responses to reduce unnecessary network calls and improve performance.
</br> </br>
📄 Pagination</br>
Implemented smooth pagination for movie lists to handle large datasets efficiently.
</br></br>
🔒 Secure Data Management</br>
Used .env and environment variables to securely store and access sensitive data like API tokens.
</br></br>
🐞 Error Tracking with Sentry</br>
Integrated Sentry to automatically track and report errors during runtime.
</br></br>

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Flutter </br>
Dart </br>
Flutter Bloc – State management </br>
Retrofit + Dio – API integration </br>
GetIt – Dependency injection </br>
Flutter ScreenUtil – Responsive UI </br>
Sentry – Error monitoring </br>

## 📸 Design Note
The app’s design was not a priority — my main goal was to practice and implement technical concepts like theming, caching, pagination, secure data, and error tracking.
